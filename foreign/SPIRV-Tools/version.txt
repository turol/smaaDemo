    Have effcee add abseil subdirectory (#5281)
    
    We currently add the abseil in the external/CMakeLists.txt. However, it
    is not needed by spirv-tools directly. Instead we set effcee's variable
    with the abseil source directory, and let effcee add it.
    
    This will mean that abseil will be checked out only if effcee is
    used. We currently get a few reports from people that use to only checkout
    spirv-headers, and now get errors because abseil is missing.

    Fix fatal bug: Threads must copy arguments. (#59)
    
    Threads were taking arguments by reference, rather than creating copies. This has been altered to the correct behavior, which should fix several fatal (and subtle) errors.
    Adds a regression test that will automatically detect similar failures (with high probability).
    
    Recommend immediate update and recompilation of all projects using this library.
